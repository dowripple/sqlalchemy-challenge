#### Description
This project looks at Hawaii weather data in a sqllite database.  The tools used are Python and SQLAlchemy.  The Jupyter notebook "climate.ipynb" does the exploration and analysis of the weather data.  The charts generated by the analysis are contained in the images folder.  The python file "app.py" will launch a flask application that will act as a api on the local machine.  The routes will lead to the different analysis results (data in json format).  Only part of the bonus is done, I'll come back later to attempt the rest!
